# ANSI-Displayer
ANSI Displayer for use with Risc OS 2 & 3 (I assume it will also run on later versions of Risc OS but I have no means of testing this).  This code branch is based on a version written for Risc OS, I am also going to setup versions for use on Windows using BBC BASIC for Windows / BBCSDL.
